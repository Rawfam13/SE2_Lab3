	The universe of warhammer is defined as being "Grimdark", where its a place you REALLY dont wanna live no matter what. 
	I love the game itself as well as the lore that has defined the many factions and the way you play.
	I have spend an ungodly amount of money on this game and shall not say how much (because idk)
